# Digital-Safe
Digital Safe Implementation using Arduino Uno R3

Hello, and welcome to my latest project! In this showcase I will be displaying the safe with an Arduino Uno!
It was fun to make though we faced many design and technical chalanges as this was the first time I made a functional project using Arduino uno.
This project uses a Keypad \(4*4\), a Piezoelectric Buzzer, a Servo Motor \(9g\), PIR sensor, Breadboard and a lot of Jumper Wires.


You could try to make this on your own and if you face any issues, feel free to contact me, I am happy to help.
